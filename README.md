# Problems

As a Data Analyst, try to solve a problem and display the results of data analysis using statistics and data visualization dashboards to solve existing problems.

Dataset from Kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/code/dgomonov/data-exploration-on-nyc-airbnb

Before determining which tables, columns, or other things in the dataset will be used for data analysis and visualization, identify and describe the problem so that it makes it easier to carry out the analysis using methods such as SWOT analysis / Fish bone diagram /5W+1H, etc.


## Notebook Information
1. Data cleaning
2. Notebooks' format:
  1. Background and Objective
  
  2. Identify the Problem
      > This section contains **problem topic**, **problem statement**, **background**, and **description of the problem** which will be analyze using statistical methods and data visualization.

  3. Data Loading
      > This section contains the *data loading* process and simple data exploration, SQL queries for data loaded from BigQuery and displaying the data

  4. Data Cleaning
      > This section contains the data preparation process in the form of data cleaning before further *data exploration* is carried out. The cleaning process can include giving a new name to each column, filling in missing values, deleting unused columns, and so on.

  5. Analysis and calculations
      > This section contains the process of analysis, explanation, calculating descriptive and inferential statistics, as well as creating data visualizations. For data visualization will be provided insight in each visualization.

  6. Drawing conclusions
      > In this final chapter, the conclusion reflects the solution/recommendation/answer to the problems raised and draws the common thread from all the analyzes and calculations briefly, clearly and concisely.

## Dashboard Information

1. Dashboard created using `Tableau` https://public.tableau.com/shared/G9MBNC4ZH?:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link

2. The dashboard created consists of 2 parts: 'Visualization' and 'Statistical Analysis' which can be made on 1 page or on multiple pages.

3. For the Visualization section:
  - There are data figures/visualizations displayed on the 'Visualization' page which correspond to those created in the Notebook.

4. For the Statistical Analysis section:
  - there is a descriptive and inferential statistical analysis process carried out in notebooks from the problems raised to the conclusions of the results of the statistical analysis.
